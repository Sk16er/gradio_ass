## Getting Started 🛠️

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sk16er/gradio_ass.git
   cd gradio_ass
   ```
# Install the required dependencies:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run this 
``` bash
pip app.py
```
## Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:7860/ to interact with the Gradio interface.
# Usage 🖥️
The app.py file contains the main logic for the Gradio interface. You can customize the input and output components, as well as the backend logic, to suit your needs.

Here’s a basic example of a Gradio interface:

``` python
import gradio as gr

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello {name}!"

iface = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs="text", outputs="text")
iface.launch()
```
- This example creates a simple interface where the user can input their name, and the application will greet them.
